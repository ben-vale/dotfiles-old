# Just all of my assorted config files

Look, I trash my own system a lot trying new things. So here's the config files for the essentials (and a few of the things that aren't). It's only public so I can easily pull the files when I need, and as an incentive to make things look pretty.

Most of this is based on the defaults provided, so this is only useful for mild improvements for me. Qtile is where the main work is being done right now.

## qtile

Dependencies: Picom, Kanshi, Rofi, Fuzzel

Choosing between X11 and Wayland is based purely on mood, so I try to accomodate both. I do like me some window shadows though.

## picom

I'm trying to get away from X11, in the meantime all the config here does is set opacity for inactive windows and shadows on window borders. Otherwise it's just the standard config so this isn't useful for anyone but me.

## alacritty

Again, currently only useful for me but I live in Alacritty so I want to do more with this.

## kanshi

Don't, it's just my screens at home. Or it serves as an example config. A really basic example config.

## hyprland

I haven't touched it aside from the default config, but I want to at some point.

## sway

This is the window manager I should be using but I love Python too much.

## arch_notes.md

I started making notes on steps to (re)install Arch Linux ages ago and have been adding to them since. Again, I want them dumped somewhere public so I can get to them in the event I brick things (Evernote was ideal but this is cooler)
