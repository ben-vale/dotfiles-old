# Just all of my assorted config files

Look, I trash my own system a lot trying new things. So here's the config files for the essentials (and a few of the things that aren't). It's only public so I can easily pull the files when I need.

Qtile is the big thing for me right now. Emphasis is on more distinction between Wayland and X11 (depends on the weather) and splitting out the config files into sections that make sense.

I'll document this properly later, right now it's only intended for me.

Wishlist: spend time messing around with Hyprland and Sway, those files are just the defaults right now.
